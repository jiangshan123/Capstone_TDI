## Small business is HUGE
According to data from the Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs, there were 5.6 million employer firms in the United States in 2016.

● Firms with fewer than 20 workers made up 89.0 percent of those business.

● Employ 50% of all private sector employees

● Pay 45% of the total U.S. private payrolls

Add in the number of nonemployer businesses – there were 24.8 million in 2016 (latest data) – then the share of U.S. businesses with less than 20 workers increases to 98.0 percent.

More and more small businesses are having their own websites or websites on eBay/Amazon/Taobao. However, the scales of the businesses prevent them from hiring a professional data analyst. Our goal is to build a customer-friendly clustring tool that can help small business owners understand their customers using machine learning.

### Goal
Clustering is a difficult problem because there isn't a good way to evaluate how "good" clusters are. We would like to have a tool that lets users add / subtract / re-weight features and visualize the resulting clusters, so they can interactively visualize what a "good" cluster is. Due to some business issues and flexibility of the package, need to write the python package from scratch.

### Delivery
Cluster customers (using K-means or DTs) using purchase history and browsing behavior where an end-user may prioritize (add weight) or eliminate features using a web-app front-end.
