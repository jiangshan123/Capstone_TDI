## Small business is HUGE
According to data from the Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs, there were 5.6 million employer firms in the United States in 2016.

● Firms with fewer than 500 workers accounted for 99.7 percent of those businesses.

● Firms with fewer than 100 workers accounted for 98.2 percent.

● Firms with fewer than 20 workers made up 89.0 percent.

Add in the number of nonemployer businesses – there were 24.8 million in 2016 (latest data) – then the share of U.S. businesses with less than 20 workers increases to 98.0 percent.

C-Corps: Among employer C corporations in 2015, according to the Census Bureau’s Statistics of U.S. Businesses, 84.9 percent had fewer than 20 employees, 96.4 percent fewer than 100, and 99.0 percent had less than 500 workers. If we add in nonemployer corporations, then those with fewer than 20 workers come in at 89.5 percent of all C corporations.
